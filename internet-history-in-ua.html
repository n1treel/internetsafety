    <h2 class="stromg">1. The Early Days of the Internet in Ukraine</h2>
    <p>Ukraine has a relatively short but eventful history when it comes to the internet. The first Ukrainian domain, .ua, was registered in 1992, just a year after the country gained its independence from the Soviet Union. However, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that the internet began to gain widespread use in Ukraine, largely due to the efforts of Ukrainian tech enthusiasts who were eager to bring the country into the digital age. By the turn of the century, internet access had become relatively common in urban areas, although rural regions still lagged behind.</p>

    <h2 class="stromg">2. The Internet and the Orange Revolution: A Turning Point in Ukraine's History</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant milestones in Ukrainian internet history was the Orange Revolution of 2004. This political movement saw widespread protests against electoral fraud and ultimately led to a new presidential election. The internet played a crucial role in spreading information about the protests, with Ukrainian bloggers and social media users sharing photos, videos, and firsthand accounts of the events as they unfolded. This helped to galvanize support for the movement both within Ukraine and around the world.</p>

    <h2 class="stromg">3. Ukraine's Thriving Tech Scene: The Internet as a Catalyst for Innovation and Growth</h2>
    <p>More recently, Ukraine has become a hub for tech startups and innovation in the region. The country's large pool of skilled developers, relatively low costs of living and doing business, and supportive government policies have made it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and investors alike. Today, Ukraine has a thriving tech scene, with numerous successful startups and established companies operating in fields ranging from e-commerce and fintech to artificial intelligence and blockchain. The internet continues to play a crucial role in Ukraine's economy and society, connecting people and businesses across the country and beyond. </p>

    <p>Some basic rules about the internet safety</p>
  </header>
  <article class="article">
    <h2 class="stromg">1. Keep your confidential data offline</h2>
    <p>Identity theft cases made up the biggest single category of crimes reported to the FTC in 2020. But
      cybercriminals cannot access or steal your personal information if it’s nowhere to be found on the internet.
      That’s why some data — such as your Social Security Number — should just never go online. However, when you still
      have to share it, be sure to send it as an email attachment and encrypt the file before sending. </p>

    <h2 class="stromg">2. Check a website’s reliability</h2>
    <p>As of January 17, 2021, Google had registered more than 2 million phishing sites. But how do you tell a reliable
      site from a fishy one? First, look at the address line: it should have a little padlock at the beginning — this
      means the connection is encrypted.</p>

  <article class="article">
    <h2 class="stromg">3. Use a strong password</h2>
    <p>Using strong, unique passwords offers good online protection. Strong passwords should contain at least 12 symbols
      and feature a mixture of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and special characters. A recent cybersecurity
      study showed that passwords under 10 characters could be cracked within an hour. However, those containing at
      least 12 characters will take about a year to break (and 15-character passwords will withstand a millenium of
      brute-force attacks). </p>

    <h2 class="stromg">4. Use two-factor authentication</h2>
    <p>“Even If someone gets a password for your account, they won’t be able to access it if it’s protected by 2FA” 2FA
      or two-factor authentication is used to provide your account with an additional layer of protection. When you sign
      into your account with 2FA, you must not only enter the correct password, but also an additional code generated
      earlier or sent to your device. If someone just gets a password for your account, they will not be able to access
      your profile without entering this additional code.</p>

    <h2 class="stromg">5. Use the Password Generator</h2>
    <p>Password generator will provide you with generate a safe password. Which is hard to remember and hard to hack.
